The Loading component is an overlay that prevents user interaction while indicating activity.
By default, it shows a spinner based on the mode. It can also be passed any HTML content to
display with the spinner. You can hide or change the spinner to any of our predefined
spinners. The loading indicator is styled to display on top of other content even during
navigation.

Check out the [API docs](../api/components/loading/Loading) for more information.

  Demo Source
</a>

```typescript
presentLoading() {
  let loading = Loading.create({
    content: "Please wait...",
    duration: 3000
  });
  this.nav.present(loading);
}
```

<h3 class="section-nav">Showing and hiding using Promises</h3>

Usually the loading indicates some form of asynchronous activity. To programatically show and hide the loading ui, you can use the returned ViewController reference to show and hide it based on the network requests success of failure.

```typescript
submit(data: any){
    //create loading notification
    let loading = Loading.create({
        content: "Submitting ..."
    });
    //display it
    this.navCtrl.present(loading);      
            
    //some backend service that returns a promise
    this.backend.submitData(data)
        .then(response =>{
            //hide it on success      
            loading.dismiss();
        })
        .catch(error =>{
            //hide it on success      
            loading.dismiss();
            //still better handle that error somehow
        });
}
```
